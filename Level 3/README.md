# HLS Project Ideas  

These are project proposals for accelerating various computational kernels using **High-Level Synthesis (HLS)** on FPGAs. Each project focuses on leveraging **HLS directives** to create efficient **dataflow pipeline designs** and optimize execution.  
- **Homomorphic Encryption Accelerator**  
    Implement a hardware pipeline for homomorphic encryption schemes, enabling secure computation on encrypted data. Optimize modular arithmetic and memory access for real-time cryptographic workloads.

- **5G MIMO Signal Processor**  
    Design a scalable MIMO (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output) signal processing engine for 5G wireless systems. Focus on parallelizing matrix operations and channel estimation using HLS dataflow techniques.

- **Error Detection and Correction Module**  
    Develop a hardware block for error detection and correction in communication systems. Utilize HLS to efficiently implement algorithms like CRC or Reed-Solomon with low latency and high throughput.
