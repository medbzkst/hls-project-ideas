# Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

## Introduction  
Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a fundamental matrix factorization technique in linear algebra. It decomposes a matrix $A$ into three components: $A = U \Sigma V^T$, where $U$ and $V$ are orthogonal matrices and $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix with the singular values of $A$. SVD is widely used in data compression, signal processing, and machine learning for dimensionality reduction and solving systems of equations.

## Applications
- **Dimensionality reduction** (Principal Component Analysis, PCA)  
- **Signal processing** (noise reduction, image compression)  
- **Data compression** (compressing large matrices or datasets)  
- **Machine learning** (feature extraction, matrix factorization in collaborative filtering)

## Why Accelerate SVD Decomposition on FPGA?  
- **Computational complexity**: SVD involves matrix manipulations that are computationally expensive. FPGA acceleration can significantly reduce the time required for decomposition.
- **Parallelism**: The operations involved in SVD, such as matrix multiplication and orthogonalization, can be parallelized, benefiting from FPGAâ€™s parallel architecture.
- **Memory optimization**: FPGAs allow custom memory layouts that help reduce bottlenecks in accessing large matrices during the decomposition process.

## An HLS Design Perspective 
- **Dataflow pipelining (`#pragma HLS dataflow`)** can be used to overlap matrix transformations, reducing idle time between operations.
- **Loop unrolling (`#pragma HLS unroll`)** allows the decomposition steps to be performed in parallel, improving throughput.
- **Memory partitioning (`#pragma HLS array_partition`)** improves access to the matrix elements, ensuring high-speed data transfers during the decomposition.
