# Top-K Selection

## Introduction  
Top-K selection refers to the problem of finding the **K largest (or smallest) elements** from a dataset. This operation is fundamental in ranking, search, and filtering applications where only the most relevant data points need to be retained. Unlike full sorting, Top-K algorithms optimize for selecting a small subset efficiently.

## Applications
- Search engine ranking (e.g., retrieving the top 10 most relevant results)  
- Network packet filtering (identifying top anomalies or threats)  
- Financial analysis (selecting top-performing stocks)  
- Recommendation systems (retrieving top-rated products or content)  

## Why Accelerate Top-K on FPGA?  
- FPGA-based acceleration can **process large data streams in real time**, which is critical for applications like high-frequency trading and network monitoring.  
- Traditional sorting algorithms have **O(N log N)** complexity, whereas specialized Top-K selection can achieve **O(N)** performance with optimizations.  
- Hardware-friendly selection algorithms (e.g., **heap-based or bitonic selection**) can be parallelized efficiently on FPGAs, enabling **low-latency, high-throughput**.  

## An HLS Design Perspective 
- **Stream-processing nature**: Instead of sorting everything, data can be processed in a pipelined fashion with a rolling selection window.  
- **Dataflow design (`#pragma HLS dataflow`)** can be used to enable concurrent comparison, selection, and insertion operations, reducing latency.  
- **Loop unrolling (`#pragma HLS unroll`)** can be applied to compare multiple elements simultaneously, accelerating the selection process.  
- **Memory partitioning** can be used to store intermediate Top-K results efficiently, reducing bottlenecks.
